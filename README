Thanks for using TownWarp:

What does this do?
This plugin allows users with permission (TW.use) to create announcements.  These announcements are chosen at random, 
and one is displayed at each time interval (configurable).  If a user uses "/tw" or "/townwarp" at any time, they warp
to the place where the latest announcement was made (ex, someone made the initial annoucement somewhere, you'll warp there)

Commands:
/tw: warps
/townwarp: warps
/twset <msg>: sets message as your announcement
/twpreview: Previews the message you made

OP
/twpreview <player>: OP command, look at others announcement
/twclear <player>: delete's a certain players announcement
/twreset: reloads config, resets timer.

Config file:
delay: time between announcements (in minutes)

nofile: Message to display if no file was found

welcome: message displayed in each announcement if welcomeOn is set

welcomeOn: boolean, whether the welcome message should be on or off.
